# Day 7 - Isn't Test Automation A Silver Bullet
[![Watch the video](thumbnails/day7.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d5r575MTGE)

 To summarize the challenges faced in Test Automation and proposals to address these issues:

1. Frequent Updates and Limited Time/Resources:
   - Encourage early QA involvement
   - Continuously maintain test cases to adapt to changes

2. Instabilities:
   - Improve test robustness by handling different actual results
   - Collaborate with development teams to improve testability
   - Prepare simulation environments for hardware dependencies or AI components

3. Testability Issues:
   - Explore various ways to improve testability with the development team
   - Set up test harness and environment when necessary

4. Non-Functional Aspects (usability, performance, maintainability, recoverability):
   - Perform chaos testing for ensuring responsiveness of the product

5. Implementation Challenges:
   - Minimize duplication and encourage reusability in test automation frameworks

6. Maintenance, Reproduction, and Execution Durations:
   - Reduce execution time by introducing parallel executions and eliminating unnecessary steps
   - Collect evidence during test runs for accurate bug reporting and reproduction

7. Difficulties related to the nature of the product or implementation methods (Agile methodologies, etc.):
   - Analyze root causes and adapt solutions accordingly in the test automation frameworks

The call-to-action is to identify problems or difficulties in the Test Automation framework and continuously work on improvements and solutions.

**Purpose:** The speaker discusses challenges faced during test automation in agile environments with frequent updates, instabilities, and testability issues. They propose solutions to cope with these difficulties, focusing on maintaining test cases, improving test robot readiness, and reducing duplication.

**Key Points:**

1. **Frequent Updates:** Agile methodologies require continuous maintenance of test cases to ensure they remain relevant.
2. **Instabilities:** The speaker suggests improving the test robot to handle various actual results and covering different scenarios.
3. **Testability Issues:** Collaborate with development teams to improve testability, prepare simulation environments, and perform manual testing as needed.
4. **Non-functional Aspects:** Test not only functionality but also usability, performance, responsiveness, maintainability, recoverability, and other non-functional aspects.
5. **Implementation Challenges:** Reduce duplication, eliminate redundancy, and encourage reusability in test automation frameworks.

**Conclusion:**
The speaker emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and addressing difficulties in test automation, such as frequent updates, instabilities, and testability issues. By proposing solutions to cope with these challenges, they aim to improve the overall effectiveness of test automation efforts.
