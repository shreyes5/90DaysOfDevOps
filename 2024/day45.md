# Day 45 - Microsoft DevOps Solutions or how to integrate the best of Azure DevOps and GitHub
[![Watch the video](thumbnails/day45.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqGUVOSRe6g)

 In summary, this video demonstrates how to integrate GitHub Actions with an existing Azure DevOps pipeline. The process involves creating a GitHub action that triggers when changes are pushed to the main branch or any other specified branch. This action calls an Azure DevOps pipeline version 1 action from the marketplace, providing necessary information such as project URL, organization name, project name, and personal access token with enough permissions to run build pipelines.

The video also introduces GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps, which allows users to leverage the same code scanning tool (CodeQL) across both platforms, making it easier to manage development and devops processes. By using these integrations, users can collaborate more effectively within their teams, streamline workflows, and take advantage of the best features from both tools.

The speaker emphasizes that the goal is not to determine which tool is better but rather to combine the strengths of both platforms to create a seamless development and devops experience. He encourages viewers to explore the other sessions in the event and looks forward to next year's Community Edition.
