 It sounds like you have built a location-based platform using Google Capture API, Firebase Authentication, Stripe for subscription management, and a custom backend. The platform allows users to submit new locations, which an admin can approve or deny. If approved, the location becomes live on the website and is searchable by other users. Users can also claim a location if it hasn't been claimed yet.

The backend provides an editor for managing locations, allowing admins to check for new locations, approve or deny requests, edit table entries, save changes, delete records, and add new ones. It also includes a search bar for easily finding specific locations.

For authenticated users (like the owner of a claimed location), they can edit their location, make changes, save, and delete. The platform is hosted on LightSail and uses GitHub for version control. A script has been created to automatically push and pull changes from Dev into the main environment, effectively acting as CI/CD.

Stripe integration allows for purchasing verification of locations. Overall, it seems like a well-thought-out and functional platform, leveraging AI and chatbots to help bring your ideas to life.
